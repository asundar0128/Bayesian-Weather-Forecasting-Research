# Bayesian-Weather-Forecasting-Research
### Architecture & Methodology

Core Model: Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (B-CNN).

Uncertainty Quantification: Utilized Monte Carlo Stochastic Approximation to handle epistemic uncertainty in atmospheric sensor data.

Comparison Baseline: Traditional SVM and Decision Tree models (outperformed by 40%).

### Key Results

Efficiency: 40% improvement in forecasting computational efficiency.

Accuracy: Significant reduction in RMSE for short-term temporal sequences compared to heuristic baselines.
